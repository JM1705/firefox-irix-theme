(the bookmark bar works fine as well, it's just retracted in the screenshot)

## Installation:

Download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JM1705/firefox-irix-theme/main/userChrome.css),
and follow [this guide](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html) to install it.

I'm pretty sure you also need the [irixium skin](https://www.opencode.net/phob1an/irixium) for kde for this to work properly.

This skin requires the window decoration to be separate, so turn on the titlebar (right click blank space next to tabs -> customize toolbar -> check titlebar in the bottom left of the screen)
